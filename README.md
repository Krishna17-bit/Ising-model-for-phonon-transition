# üåÄ Ising Model for Phonon Transition

This project is an exploration of the interaction between phonons and phase transitions in solids using the Ising model. The study combines analytical solutions, numerical simulations, and machine learning techniques to model and analyze the behavior of lattice vibrations and their impact on phase transitions.

## üåç Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- **Lattice Vibrations**: Analyze and simulate the motion of atoms vibrating in a lattice and their effects on phase transitions using the Ising model.
- **Machine Learning**: Develop a neural network to detect phase transitions in condensed matter systems.
- **Numerical Solutions**: Solve coupled differential equations to model lattice vibrations.
- **Electrical Analogue**: Construct and analyze the electrical analogue of lattice vibrations using capacitors and inductors.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`Ising Model Neural Network.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the neural network implementation to detect phase transitions using the Ising model.
- **`Data generation ising model.ipynb`**: Notebook detailing the Monte Carlo simulations and data generation for the Ising model.
- **`Ising_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`**: Notebook exploring logistic regression on the Ising model data.
